# Rhinoceros For Windows [2025]
Rhinoceros (Rhino or Rhino3D) is a powerful 3D computer graphics and computer-aided design (CAD) software developed by Robert McNeel & Associates. It is widely used in various fields such as architecture, industrial design, jewelry design, automotive design, and marine design due to its flexibility, precision, and wide compatibility with other software.

### NURBS Modeling
- Rhino is based on NURBS (Non-Uniform Rational B-Splines), allowing for accurate and mathematically defined curves and surfaces.
- Unlike mesh-based models (e.g., in Blender or SketchUp), NURBS provide smooth and highly controllable surfaces.
### Precision Modeling
- Suitable for tasks requiring high accuracy like architecture, jewelry, and product design.
- Allows modeling at any scale â€” from microns (jewelry) to kilometers (urban planning).
